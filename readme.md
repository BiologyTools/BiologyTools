All programs & libraries share the ability to save images in ImageJ tiff format with additional metadata which can be opened using any Bio library based program. Bio includes ability to easily create tool scripts, functions, which includes ImageJ macro functions. Bio currently integrates with ImageJ/Fiji through the macro language as well importing & exporting ImageJ ROIs. Scripting with ImageJ & C# can be a powerful tool especially when image acquistion can be controlled programmatically as well. This is what BioImager specializes in with the Microscope class that can control Zeiss, & Prior as well as any microscope supported by [Python-Microscope](https://github.com/python-microscope/microscope).
